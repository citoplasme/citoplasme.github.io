The Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND) is a national program of research and learning. Our community includes persons with lived experience, caregivers, researchers, healthcare providers, government agencies, industry partners, and mental health advocates who are working together to achieve mental wellness for all Canadians. CAN-BIND is discovering ways to identify the right treatment for the right person in order to help individuals with depression get well quickly, and stay well.

<b>Vision</b>: Improving depression care together through innovation, education and practice

<b>Mission</b>: Our mission is to deliver fast and effective care to all Canadians living with depression. Through collaboration, research innovation and systems-oriented thinking, we seek to discover treatment strategies guided by each individual’s comprehensive history and pathway to depression.
