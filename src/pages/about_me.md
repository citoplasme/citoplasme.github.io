---

I have a bachelor's and a master's degrees from the
[Faculty of Engineering](https://www.eng.uminho.pt/pt) of the
[University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/) in software
engineering. I have specialized in data science, data parsing and web
development. In fact, I have worked on a number of projects within these
fields, academically and professionally.

Since the start of 2023, I am a computer science PhD student under
the supervision of professor
[Frank Rudzicz](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~rudzicz/) at
[Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca). I am also affiliated 
with [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai) as a graduate
student.

I have worked as a research assistant on several [projects](/projects) 
alongside world renowned experts (e.g., [Frank Rudzicz](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~rudzicz/), 
[Lu√≠s Torgo](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~ltorgo/), and [Paulo J. Azevedo](https://www.di.uminho.pt/~pja/)).
I have also worked as a full-stack sofware developer at
one of biggest insurance brokers in Portugal, where I was responsible
for the development of a web application to analyze the insurance claims
of the company's clients.

My main interests lie in the field of data science, specifically in
machine and deep learning, natural language processing, speech processing,
forecasting, spatiotemporal data analysis and explainable AI. 
My goal is to use AI to improve everyday life. 

I am a strong supporter of the open-source and open-science movements. 
As a result, I try to make all of my work fully available on 
[Github](https://github.com/citoplasme) for the sake of reproducibility.
