I have a Bachelor's and a Master's degrees from the
[Faculty of Engineering](https://www.eng.uminho.pt/pt) of the
[University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/) in Software
Engineering. I have specialized in both data science and web
development. In fact, I have worked on a number of projects in both
fields, academically and professionally.

Starting on January 2023, I will be a Computer Science PhD student under
the supervision of Professor
[Luís Torgo](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~ltorgo/) at
[Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca).

I have worked as a research assistant at
[INESCTEC](https://www.inesctec.pt) within the scope of the
[Nitrolimit](https://www2.ciimar.up.pt/projects.php?id=84)
project alongside Professors
[Luís Torgo](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~ltorgo/) and
[Catarina Magalhães](https://www2.ciimar.up.pt/team.php?id=85).
After that, I have also worked as a full stack sofware developer at
one of biggest insurance brokers in Portugal, where I was responsible
for the development of a web application to analyze the insurance claims
of the company's clients.

My main interests are in the field of data science, specifically in
Machine and Deep learning, forecasting, and spatiotemporal data
analysis. Moreover, I am a strong supporter of the open-source and
open-science movements. As a result, I try to make all of my work fully
available for the sake of reproducibility.
