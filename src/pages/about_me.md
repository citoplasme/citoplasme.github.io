I have a Bachelor's and a Master's degrees from the
[Faculty of Engineering](https://www.eng.uminho.pt/pt) of the
[University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/) in Software
Engineering. I have specialized in both Data Science and Web
Development. In fact, I have worked on a number of projects in both
fields, academically and professionally.

Since the start of 2023, I am a Computer Science PhD student under
the supervision of Professor
[Frank Rudzicz](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~rudzicz/) at
[Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca).

I have worked as a research assistant at
[INESCTEC](https://www.inesctec.pt) within the scope of the
[Nitrolimit](https://www2.ciimar.up.pt/projects.php?id=84)
project alongside Professors
[Luís Torgo](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~ltorgo/) and
[Catarina Magalhães](https://www2.ciimar.up.pt/team.php?id=85).
After that, I have also worked as a full stack sofware developer at
one of biggest insurance brokers in Portugal, where I was responsible
for the development of a web application to analyze the insurance claims
of the company's clients.

My main interests are in the field of Data Science, specifically in
Machine and Deep learning, forecasting, and spatiotemporal data
analysis. I am also interested in Natural Language Processing and 
using AI to improve everyday life. Moreover, I am a strong supporter 
of the open-source and open-science movements. As a result, I try 
to make all of my work fully available for the sake of reproducibility.
